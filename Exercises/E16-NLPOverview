Houndify is a Product from the company SoundHound.
Houndify is an integrate voice and conversational intelligence through an independent platform that is always learning. Customize, innovate, and differentiate while maintaining their clients brand and users independent.

Houndify have 4 main components: Speech-to-Meaning, Supports Context and Follow‑up, Deep Meaning Understanding and Collective AI.

Speech-to-Meaning, basically, understand the meaning, not just the words. The Speech-to-Meaning engine is focused on the speed and accuracy and can be integrated with mobile applications, cloud software, connected devices and, ultimately, the Internet of Things.
Supports Context and follow up use context, such as the user's location or previous queries, to support natural interactions.
Deep Meaning Understanding gives the ability to ask multiple question at the same time, as any conversation, and allows the processing to give an answer with the all details asked.
And the last component, but probably, the most powerful is the Collective AI... is an architecture for contribution and collaboration among developers, where they can easily extend the functionality of existing Artificial Intelligence domains. It offers comprehensive knowledge, that is always learning, is crowdsourced to domain experts, and is larger than the sum of its parts — ensuring that your solutions and smart IoT devices continue to grow smarter into the future.

The Houndify (and SoundHound) technology combines both Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) into one engine, resulting in dramatically increased speed & accuracy.

The product itself is just an application of Natural Processing Language to the level transforming it to Natural Language Understanding. Because this, the Core principle of Houndify is the Live Transcription; Live Transcription displays what the user is saying and also predicts what the user is likely to say based on Houndify’s NLU algorithms.
